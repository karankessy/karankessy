      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever had one of those technical problems that just keeps coming back like a persistent itch? That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what we faced with our video KYC application. Users were going through a long never-ending buffering repeatedly, and our team was determined to get to the bottom of it. Let me walk you through our journey from chaos to resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-mystery-begins&#34;&gt;The Mystery Begins&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our vKYC application was acting like a finicky door that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stay shut. Users would connect, only to be left buffering, over and over again. It was like watching a digital game of whack-a-mole, and we needed to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
