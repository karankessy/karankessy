## Threat Classification

Threat classification has been a go to process for categorizing security risks or potential dangers based on their level of severity and impact. This helps organizations prioritize their security measures and allocate resources effectively to mitigate the most critical threats.

### Threat Classification Concepts

#### Known-Knowns

"Known-knowns" refers to the threats that are known and understood by the organization. These threats are well documented, and mitigation strategies are in place.

#### Known-Unknowns

"Known-unknowns" refers to the threats that are recognized but not fully understood by the organization. While the organization is aware of the potential risks, the exact nature of the threat and its impact remain unclear.

#### Unknown-Knowns

"Unknown-knowns" refers to situations where an organization is aware of a potential threat but chooses to ignore or dismiss it. This could be due to reasons such as complacency, lack of resources, or the belief that the threat is unlikely to occur.

#### Unknown-Unknowns

"Unknown-unknowns" refers to threats that are completely unknown to the organization and may emerge from new or unforeseen sources. These threats can be particularly dangerous as the organization is not prepared to mitigate or defend against them.

### Conclusion

Threat classification is a vital process for organizations to effectively manage their security risks. By categorizing potential threats based on their level of severity and impact, organizations can prioritize their security measures and allocate resources to mitigate the most critical risks.

It is important for organizations to recognize all types of threats, including known-knowns, known-unknowns, unknown-knowns, and unknown-unknowns. By doing so, they can take proactive measures to reduce the likelihood and impact of security incidents, ensuring the safety and protection of their assets and stakeholders.
